# Welcome to the Windsurf Demo

Welcome! This demo showcases Windsurf's AI-powered development capabilities using a real-world FastAPI + Next.js application.

## What You'll Experience

This hands-on session demonstrates how Cascade, Windsurf's AI assistant, accelerates common development tasks:

### 1. Project Setup
- Environment configuration and dependency management
- Running the application locally

### 2. Code Refactoring
- Identifying and removing dead code (v1/v2 API duplication)
- Safe method renaming with test verification
- Understanding how Cascade navigates complex codebases

### 3. Feature Development
- Building a new Bookmarks feature from scratch
- Spec creation and test-driven development
- Full implementation with Cascade guidance

### 4. CI/CD Automation
- Creating linting configurations
- GitHub Actions workflow generation
- Automated quality checks on pull requests

## Getting Started

**First time here?** Run `/setup` to configure your development environment and get the application running locally.

Once setup is complete, you can explore the other demo sections:
- `/refactor-dead-code` — Clean up v1/v2 API duplication
- `/new-feature` — Build the Bookmarks feature with TDD
- `/create-ci` — Set up GitHub Actions for linting and testing
